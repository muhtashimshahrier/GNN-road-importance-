# Road Segment Importance Prediction using Graph Neural Networks

This project predicts the relative **importance of road segments** in the urban road network of **Dhaka, Bangladesh** using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) pipeline.

We extract a real road network using **OSMnx**, engineer graph-based features, assign multi-class importance labels using OpenStreetMap `highway` tags, and train a GNN (MLP baseline) using **PyTorch Geometric**.

## 🚀 Future Work

- Use GCN, GraphSAGE, or GAT architectures
- Normalize features and expand input dimensions
- Add road curvature, degree centrality, or clustering coefficient
- Use satellite or traffic data for richer features
- Generalize to Bangladesh-wide road network
